- **R**: Restart game (when game over)

### 2. C++ Version with SFML
The C++ version uses SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) for cross-platform compatibility.

**Prerequisites:**
- macOS with Homebrew installed
- SFML 2.x library

**Installation:**
```bash
# Install SFML 2.x
brew install sfml@2

# Set environment variables (if needed)
export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/sfml@2/lib"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/sfml@2/include"
```

**Building:**
```bash
cd "Space Invaders/CPP-Space-Invaders-Game-with-raylib"
make
```

**Running:**
```bash
./space_invaders
```

**Controls:**
- **Arrow Left/Right**: Move player ship
- **Space**: Fire bullet
- **R**: Restart game (when game over)

### 3. Original C++ Version with raylib (Deprecated)
The original version used raylib but had compatibility issues on macOS ARM64.

**Issues:**
- Architecture mismatch (x86_64 vs ARM64)
- C++ standard library header problems
- Complex dependency management

## 🚀 Quick Start

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Web Version Issues
- **Game not loading**: Ensure JavaScript is enabled in your browser
- **Controls not working**: Click on the game canvas first to focus it
- **Performance issues**: Close other browser tabs to free up resources

### C++ SFML Issues
- **SFML not found**: Ensure SFML 2.x is installed via Homebrew
- **Compilation errors**: Check that environment variables are set correctly
- **Runtime errors**: Ensure all asset files (fonts, graphics) are in the correct locations

### Common macOS Issues
- **Architecture mismatch**: Use SFML 2.x instead of SFML 3.x
- **Header not found**: Set CPPFLAGS to point to SFML include directory
- **Library not found**: Set LDFLAGS to point to SFML library directory
